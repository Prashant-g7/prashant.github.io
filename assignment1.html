                    <p>A travel photographer is a professional or an amateur who is involved in the photographic
                        documentation of an area's landscape, people, cultures, customs and history. A travel photo is
                        an image that expresses the feeling of a time and place, portrays a land, its people, or a
                        culture in its natural state.
                    </p>

                    <p>Out of the different genres of photography, travel photography is the most appealing to many. A
                        travel photographer gets a chance to experience places, people, and cultures while doing
                        photography. And one tries to bring the viewer to the same experience through the photographs.
                        It offers a fair share of the adrenaline rush, money, and accolades. However, choosing to
                        combine a life of wanderlust with your profession has its own set of challenges. Like other
                        career and business options, travel photography can offer you every bit of joy and learning
                        experience that you want both from traveling the world and from the career of photography,
                        provided that you can manage and scale things up, focus on brand building and market your work
                        effectively. Travel photography is primarily about photographing places in all their glory. As a
                        travel photographer, you will travel to lots of places and capture them through your camera. The
                        places can be tourist attractions, natural landscapes, hotels and resorts, cultural experiences,
                        and outdoor adventures. Most professional travel photography is in some way or the other linked
                        with the tourism industry, generating imagery for magazines, brochures, advertising,
                        merchandise, and online media.

                    <p>When you think about traveling the globe and taking pictures, what types of images are you most
                        interested in capturing? Does your lens gravitate toward landscapes and natural wonders,
                        wildlife, people, art, cultural landmarks and events, food, architecture or all of the above?

                        Do you prefer to shoot in wild environments or concrete jungles? Are you more interested in
                        modern life or ancient traditions?</p>
                    <p>
                        It is possible to teach yourself everything you need to know about photographs and editing if
                        you are extremely self-disciplined. However, taking a photography course is a wonderful way to
                        learn the basics or to advance your skills.
                        If you live in a big city or town that has a community college, you can likely find a
                        photography course.
